# Bluai — Landing page

Marketing landing page for **Bluai**, a hurricane/disaster preparedness app
(AI guidance, family geolocation and official alerts).

Built with **Next.js 14 (App Router)**, **TypeScript**, **Tailwind CSS**,
**GSAP** (scroll animations) and **Three.js** (the animated contact backdrop).

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # http://localhost:3000
```

Other scripts:

```bash
npm run build    # production build
npm run start    # serve the production build
npm run lint     # ESLint
```

## Membership download flow

The membership cards now prioritize app download. The intended flow is:

1. The user chooses a membership on the landing page.
2. The landing page sends them to download the app.
3. The membership is purchased inside the app on the user's phone.

Configure these public environment variables in `.env.local`:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_STORE_URL=https://apps.apple.com/your-app
NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_PLAY_URL=https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=your.app
```

## Project structure

```
app/                 App Router entry (layout, page, global styles)
components/
  layout/            Header, Footer
  sections/          One file per page section (Hero, Stats, Membership, ...)
  ui/                Reusable pieces (GlassCard, PriceCard, PreventionCard, ...)
  fx/                Animation/effect components (see below)
lib/                 gsap setup, in-view hook, and all site copy (content.ts)
public/assets/       Images (logo, photos, store badges, social icons)
```

### Section order

Header → Hero → Reality → Stats → Membership → Prevention → Video → Contact →
Community CTA → Footer.

### Effects (`components/fx/`)

- **CountUp** — statistics count up when scrolled into view.
- **LiquidGradient** — animated WebGL (Three.js) gradient behind the contact section.
- **LiquidGlass / GlassDefs** — frosted "liquid glass" surfaces used by cards and form fields.
- **MobileParallax** — decorative scroll-driven lines, mounted **only on mobile**.
- **Reveal** — fade-up entrance animation used throughout.

All effects respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.

## Location-based hero

The hero background adapts to the visitor's **geographic region in Mexico**
(4 regions from the reference map → a representative city scene, calm + hurricane):

- 🔵 Noroeste / Occidente → **Los Cabos**
- 🔴 Noreste, Centro y Este → **Veracruz**
- 🟢 Sur (Pacífico) → **Acapulco**
- 🟣 Península de Yucatán → **Playa del Carmen**

Detection (`lib/region.ts` → `detectRegion()`) runs in two tiers:

1. **`/api/region`** (primary) — a route handler that reads the hosting/CDN
   geo headers (AWS CloudFront, Vercel, Cloudflare). No third party, no limits.
   Returns `null` on local dev or a fully static export.
2. **geojs.io** (fallback) — a keyless, HTTPS, CORS-enabled geo-IP service
   called from the browser when the route returns nothing.

If both fail or the visitor is outside Mexico, `DEFAULT_REGION` is used. The
state → region mapping (codes + names) lives in the same file.

> Tier 2 sends the visitor's IP to geojs.io — for a no-third-party setup, deploy
> on a platform that provides viewer-geo headers so tier 1 resolves it. Many
> geo-IP APIs block CORS on their free tier (e.g. ipwho.is); geojs.io allows
> browser calls. On CloudFront, whitelist the `CloudFront-Viewer-Country*`
> headers in the cache/origin-request policy.

On desktop the hero is a **split**: left = calm scene, right = hurricane. Hovering
a side expands it and emphasizes that side's cards (the card title and body reveal
character-by-character via `CharReveal`). The phone (`components/ui/StaticPhone.tsx`)
is static — it shows the Bluai logo, sits flush with the bottom edge of the hero, and
does not animate. The navbar shows a device-appropriate store badge on mobile
(`useDevice`: iOS → App Store, Android → Google Play) and both badges on desktop.

## Editing content

Almost all text and structured data (nav, hero features, stats, plans,
prevention cards, socials, footer links) lives in **`lib/content.ts`** — edit
there rather than in the section components.

## Placeholders to replace

These were intentionally left as placeholders, ready to wire up:

- **Links** (`href="#"`): navigation, social networks, store badges and footer/legal links.
- **Contact form** (`components/sections/Contact.tsx`): currently front-end validation only.
  Connect it to your email service / API where the `TODO` comment is.
- **Newsletter form** (`components/ui/NewsletterForm.tsx`): submit is a no-op.
- **Video** (`components/sections/Video.tsx`): styled player placeholder — swap in the real
  `<video>` source or embed.

> Reminder: keep any API keys / secrets in environment variables, never in the code.

## Theme

Brand colors and fonts are defined in `tailwind.config.ts` and `app/globals.css`
(palette sampled from the source artwork). Fonts: **Poppins** (UI/headings) and
**Anton** (impact numbers), loaded via `next/font`.
